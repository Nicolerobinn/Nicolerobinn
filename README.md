## Hi, I'm Nick 👨‍💻‍


## This is me

I research ways to make programming better for everyone by studying developers and programming communities aswell as designing intelligent tools that make building software easier.

* Good at JavaScript and related technology stacks, like to promote TypeScript.

* Like using react-native, tauri. And I'm  learning rust and rescript.

* I am good at finding fun in work, like to solve problems with friends and colleagues, and want to do things better.

* I like to explore new ideas, learn new techniques and keep moving forward.
